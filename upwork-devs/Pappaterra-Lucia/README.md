# Organization Chart Visualization

Jupyter-Notebook Org_Chart_Vis.pynb generates visualizations from the sheets in 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jX-FBOynt0A-uwVPk2EZRB2rsX3_c_2b/view

that are constantly being updated.

Before running it, it's necessary to generate .csv and yaml files from sheets
latest version. To do so Jupyter-Notebook Generate_files.ipynb must be run.

This generates the required files that will be saved in the folders csv_files 
and yaml_files respectively, for later use in updated visualizations.
